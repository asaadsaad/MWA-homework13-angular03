## Coding Exercise
* Use Express/Mongoose to create a web-server that implements `GET`, `DELETE` HTTP verbs for an entity called `courses`. A course object has the following structure:
```javascript
{_id: 1, title:'Modern Web Application', code:'CS572', program: 'Computer Science'}
```

  * Showing list of courses (use TitleCasePipe)
